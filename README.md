*DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK 3*:

AS PART OF THE INTERNSHIP PROGRAM OF FULL STACK WEB DEVELOPMENT FROM CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS, I HAVE DEVELOPED A REAL TIME COLLABORATIVE DOCUMENT EDITOR USING MODERN WEB TECHNOLOGIES. 

THE PROJECT ACTUALLY ALLOWS MULTIPLE USERS TO COLLABORATIVELY EDIT A SHARED DOCUMENT IN REAL TIME. CHANGES MADE BY ONE OF THE USERS INSTANTLY REFLECT TO ALL OTHER CONNECTED USERS.

THIS PROJECTS DEMONSTRATES THE FRONTEND FRAMEWORKS, BACKEND LOGIC, WEBSOCKETS AND MONGODB FOR DATA PERSISTANCE. IN THIS PROJECT I HAVE ADDED MANT FEATURES LIKE:

REAL TIME DOCUMENT EDITING FOR ALLOWING MULTIPLE USERS TO EDIT A DOCUMENT.

USER IDENTIFICATION FEATURE TO SEE HOW MANY USERS ARE USING THIS DUOCUMENT WITH ONLINE USER COUNTER AT THE LEFT CORNER TOP TO SEE HOW AMNY PEOPLE ARE USING AT THE MOMENT OF TIME.

IT ALSO AS SOME TEXT STYLE TOOLS LIKE THE BASIC STYLINGS LIKE BOLD, ITALIC, UNDERLINE USING THE BUTTOONS. IT ALSO HAS THE HEADINGS FORMAT STYLE TEXT PRESENT IN THE DOCUMENT EDITIOR.

FIRST FOR LEARNING ABOUT THE MONGODB, NODE.JS AND REACT.JS I HAVE SEEN SOME VIDEOS IN THE YOUTUBR PLATFORM AND ALSO ACCESSSED SOME WEBSITES LIKE GEEKSFORGEEKS TO UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT.

THE TOOLS I HAVE USED ARE:

IN FRONTEND I HAVE USED HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT AND INSTALLED AN ADDITINAL FEATURE CALLED SOCKET.IO TO ENABLE REAL TIME MESSAGING.

IN THE BACKEND I HAVE USED NODE.JS FOR BACKEND RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT. MONGODB FOR STORING THE DATA.
I HAVE USED THE PLATFORM VISUAL STUDIO CODE TO WORK ON THE PROJECT. IT WAS DIFFICULT TO WORK IN VS CODE DUE TO NOT HAVIN PROPER KNOWLEDGE AND ALSO TACKLED SOME PROBLEMS BUT USING THE AI CHATS BOTS LIKE CHATGPT, GEMINI, DEEPSEEK ETC HELPED ME FINISH MY PROJECT.

I HAVE ALSO TOOK SOME IDEAS OF GEEKSFORGEEKS EXAMPLE OF REAL TIME DOOCUMENT EDITOR TO WORK ON THIS PROJECT.

THROUGH THS PROJECT I HAVE LEARNED HOW TO USE AI TOOLS, PRACTISED FULL STACK DEVELOPMENT, UNDERSTOOD FRONTEND AND BACKEND INTEGRATIONS AND GOT TO KNOW ABOUT THE MONGODB.
